This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



These codes are for Q1 
```{r}
itemsets <- apriori(Groceries, parameter=list(minlen=1, maxlen=1, support=0.015, target="frequent itemsets"))
```

Q2 
```{r}
rules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter=list(support=0.002, confidence=0.5, target = "rules"))
inspect(head(sort(rules, by ="confidence"),15))

```
Q3
```{r}
plot(rules, method="matrix", measure=c("lift", "confidence"))

```
